I've recently tested several prominent AI-first IDEs from late 2024 and early 2025: [**Cursor**](https://cursor.sh), [**Windsurf**](https://windsurf.io), [**Zed**](https://zed.dev), [**Aide**](https://aide.dev), along with established AI assistants [**GitHub Copilot**](https://github.com/features/copilot), [**Sourcegraph Cody**](https://sourcegraph.com/cody), and [**Amazon Q**](https://aws.amazon.com/amazonq). Here's my concise take on each—including pricing—to help you choose the best IDE for your workflow.

## Cursor: AI Pair Programming On Steroids

[**Cursor**](https://cursor.sh) feels like an upgraded VS Code—familiar yet powerful. Its **Agent Mode** and **Composer** features stand out, allowing complex multi-file refactoring simply by describing changes in natural language. The AI suggestions are highly context-aware, and you always retain full control—changes are easy to review and selectively apply, aligning perfectly with the "trust but verify" approach.

**Pricing:**  
- **Free tier** available  
- **Pro Plan:** $20/month (advanced LLM integrations like GPT-4, Claude 3.5)  
- **Enterprise:** Custom pricing available

## Windsurf: Codeium's Autonomous Coder

  alt="Windsurf IDE interface"

[**Windsurf**](https://windsurf.io) offers more autonomy with its agent-driven **Cascade AI**. It proactively suggests and even applies multi-step changes across multiple files. It's highly effective at automating tedious tasks, but the degree of autonomy can sometimes feel too bold—less aligned with a cautious, review-first mindset.

**Pricing:**  
- **Free tier:** Unlimited basic AI features  
- **Pro subscription:** $15/month (premium LLM access like Claude 3.5)  
- **Enterprise plans** available

## Zed: Collaboration Meets AI Speed

<BlogImage

  alt="Zed IDE interface"
  width={800}
  height={450}
/>

[**Zed**](https://zed.dev) emphasizes real-time collaborative coding combined with powerful inline AI editing. It's extremely fast and provides transparent control over AI interactions, ideal for teams that frequently collaborate on the same files simultaneously. Its UI is polished, though slightly different from VS Code.

**Pricing:**  
- **Free:** Collaborative editing and basic AI  
- **Zed Pro:** $12/month per user (includes Anthropic's Claude 3.5)  
- **Team and Enterprise plans** available

## Aide: Open-Source AI for Privacy-Minded Developers

<BlogImage
  src="/assets/blog/personal-ides/aide.png"
  alt="Aide IDE interface"
  width={800}
  height={450}
/>

[**Aide**](https://aide.dev) is fully open-source, allowing integration with various local or remote LLMs. It proactively aids debugging, provides inline transformations, and has a thoughtful rollback mechanism to quickly revert unwanted AI edits. It's great for developers prioritizing privacy and extensive customization but slightly less polished compared to commercial alternatives.

**Pricing:**  
- Completely **free** (open-source)  
- Cost depends only on chosen external LLM APIs or local models

## Copilot (VSCode): Effortless and Popular AI Coding

  alt="GitHub Copilot in VSCode"
  width={800}
  height={450}

[**GitHub Copilot**](https://github.com/features/copilot) feels intuitive right from the start. The inline suggestions powered by GPT-4 integrate seamlessly into VS Code and make general coding tasks noticeably faster. It's excellent for quickly generating boilerplate code or exploring unfamiliar APIs.

**Pricing:**  
- **Individual Plan:** ~$10/month  
- **Copilot for Business:** ~$19/user/month  
- **Free** for students and open-source maintainers

## Cody: Ideal for Navigating Large Codebases

<BlogImage

After testing [**Sourcegraph Cody**](https://sourcegraph.com/cody), I appreciated its ability to deeply understand and reference my entire project. Cody's context-aware suggestions saved significant time navigating complex projects and onboarding new team members. It's especially powerful if you're maintaining consistency across large codebases.

**Pricing:**  
- **Free tier:** Limited use on Sourcegraph's cloud  
- **Enterprise:** Custom pricing, typically bundled with Sourcegraph Enterprise (self-hosting options available)

## Amazon Q: Comprehensive but AWS-Focused

<BlogImage
  src="/assets/blog/personal-ides/amazon.png"
  alt="Amazon Q interface"
  width={800}
  height={450}
/>

Using [**Amazon Q**](https://aws.amazon.com/amazonq), I found it particularly powerful when integrated within the AWS ecosystem. Its comprehensive capabilities—from coding and testing to documentation and reviews—are impressive, especially if you're already embedded in AWS infrastructure. Outside AWS tasks, its effectiveness was good, though not quite as universally intuitive as Copilot.

**Pricing:**  
- **Free tier:** Available with AWS Builder ID  
- **Pro and Business tiers:** Custom pricing available
