I've recently tested several prominent AI-first IDEs from late 2024 and early 2025: **Cursor**, **Windsurf**, **Zed**, **Aide**, along with established AI assistants **GitHub Copilot**, **Sourcegraph Cody**, and **Amazon Q**. To provide a more comprehensive comparison, I've evaluated each based on the following criteria: **Pricing**, **Onboarding**, **UI/UX**, **Transparency**, **Efficiency**, **Code Quality**, **Context Management**, **Privacy**, and **Features**.

## Evaluation Criteria

Each tool is evaluated based on the following criteria and scored from 1 to 10:
- **Pricing**: Affordability and available plans
- **Onboarding**: Ease of getting started
- **UI/UX**: Intuitiveness and user experience
- **Transparency**: Clarity on changes and suggestions
- **Efficiency**: Speed and productivity impact
- **Code Quality**: Accuracy and best practices
- **Context Management**: Handling large codebases and context
- **Privacy**: Data safety and user control
- **Features**: Breadth and uniqueness of functionalities

## Cursor: AI Pair Programming On Steroids

**Cursor** feels like an upgraded VS Codeâ€”familiar yet powerful. Standout features like **Agent Mode**, **Composer**, and the experimental **Bug Finder** allow complex multi-file refactoring with natural language descriptions. Context-aware AI suggestions are transparent and easy to review.

### Problems Encountered
- Context limits became noticeable in large projects, requiring more review cycles.
- The **Bug Finder** tool, although promising, sometimes provides false positives or irrelevant suggestions when dealing with highly modular codebases.
- Adding new files to the context can be cumbersome, and files tend to disappear on every request, forcing users to re-add them manually.

## Windsurf: Codeium's Autonomous Coder

**Windsurf** leverages **Cascade AI** to autonomously apply multi-file edits. Highly efficient for automation but less transparent and requires vigilant oversight.

### Problems Encountered
- Over-aggressive suggestions required frequent intervention, particularly when refactoring complex logic.
- **Cascade AI** can sometimes break existing functionality when making changes, making it risky for large and interconnected codebases.

## Zed: Collaboration Meets AI Speed

**Zed** shines in real-time collaborative coding combined with powerful inline AI editing. Great UI/UX and transparency, ideal for collaborative teams.

### Problems Encountered
- Slight learning curve due to unfamiliar UI.
- While collaboration works seamlessly in small teams, scaling up to larger groups occasionally results in synchronization delays or conflicts, especially in fast-paced editing scenarios.

## Aide: Open-Source AI for Privacy-Minded Developers

**Aide** offers full open-source flexibility with extensive customizability. Privacy-focused but slightly less polished in UX.

### Problems Encountered
- UX is less intuitive, and initial configuration can be complex.
- Limited support compared to commercial alternatives, as the open-source nature means that compatibility issues can arise after updates.

## Copilot: Effortless and Popular AI Coding

**GitHub Copilot** provides intuitive GPT-4 powered inline suggestions. Highly efficient for routine tasks and exploring APIs.

### Problems Encountered
- Limited context awareness in large projects.
- Occasionally makes inaccurate assumptions about variable naming and scope, leading to suggestions that may not align with the current code style or logic.

## Cody: Ideal for Navigating Large Codebases

**Sourcegraph Cody** excels with deep, contextual insights across entire projects, significantly boosting onboarding and consistency.

### Problems Encountered
- Initial setup can be time-consuming.
- UX complexity may overwhelm users unfamiliar with Sourcegraph.
- Processing very large repositories can slow down performance.

## Amazon Q: Comprehensive but AWS-Focused

**Amazon Q** integrates well with AWS workflows, offering extensive lifecycle management capabilities.

### Problems Encountered
- Less intuitive outside AWS-specific contexts.
- Can be resource-intensive, leading to slower performance during complex lifecycle operations on large applications.

## Overall Comparison

After thorough testing and scoring, **Cursor** remains my top choice. Its robust transparency, feature set, and excellent UI align perfectly with my "trust but verify" approach.

*Choosing the right tool ultimately depends on your specific use case and preferences. I hope this breakdown helps you make an informed decision.*
