title: 'Choosing the Right Software in an Era of Vaporware'
---

Working in the custom-software industry means that, more often than not, I’m comparing what **we** can achieve for our customers with what’s already on the market, neatly packaged and sold as SaaS. That exercise usually involves digging through documentation, marketing pages, slick websites, and a never-ending stream of **“we-can-do-everything”** sales pitches that too often turn into unfulfilled promises. There’s a persistent disconnect between product and sales: sales swears everything is possible but there’s always a * lurking somewhere.

Let’s get real.

## The StorageInc * - A Case Study

A few years ago, I watched a company, let’s call them **Acme**, sign a contract with a file-storage vendor we’ll dub **StorageInc**. Acme needed to stash terabytes of files and make them searchable so users could review documents and use them as learning materials. StorageInc’s pitch sounded perfect: “Just store your files with us, hit the API with a search term, and boom! instant results.” Simpler than anything else I could find at the time.

Search was mission-critical for Acme. With all the security layers and a long list of other must-haves, they inked a multimillion-dollar deal. Only afterward did I discover the ominous *: **the search indexed only the first 10 pages** of any file. Acme had documents hundreds of pages long massive problem.

Then came user mapping. Because of how billing worked, Acme couldn’t do a 1-to-1 mapping between their users and StorageInc’s authorization system. Another fact learned too late.

The result? A legal battle to break the contract because, suddenly, building the entire service in-house was cheaper than using StorageInc.

## Vaporware, Super-Charged by AI

That wasn’t the last time I saw a client blindsided by half-baked features. And with AI hype everywhere, I’m afraid we’ll see a lot more of it. Every new AI-powered product demo promises the moon, while under the hood the functionality is half-built, misunderstood by developers, or riddled with security gaps.

We’ve always had vaporware, now it just feels like **most** of what’s out there is vaporware.

We are shipping features faster than ever, but it doesn't not mean we are keeping up with the product quality.

## Before You Swipe Your Credit Card

These days it’s easier than ever to sell shiny features behind a polished UI that don’t actually exist. So before you commit:

1. **Understand the app’s true proposal.**  
2. **Review the full feature set and the fine print.**  
3. **Talk to a human.** Ask direct yes/no questions; don’t accept “it depends.”  
4. **Run a trial, if possible.**  
5. **Never** commit to more than a few hundred dollars without serious due diligence.

Choosing the right software in an era of vaporware is less about dazzling demos and more about ruthless verification. Keep your guard up, dig for the *, and don’t let the promise of “AI magic” cloud your judgment.
