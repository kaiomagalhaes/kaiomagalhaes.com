### my history

Even though I officially started in the engineering field in 2011, my career began when I was 8 years old,
but I have to admit that I could only break electronics apart at the time. Fortunately, years later I learned how to put them back together.
The idea of building things has always been a part of me, but it took me a long time to define what I wanted to build. 
The moment I had my first computer in my hands, I knew I wanted to make software.

My software journey began in 2011 as a teacher in a tiny college in [Goiânia](https://goo.gl/maps/XB5XUK1ige3VgzLB9).

While organizing the grades of my students, I saw the amount of work that one could automate, and that could save teachers time. 
By then, I learned how to program in PHP to start a project that would help me with that. Soon after that, I realized
I could make that hobby into a career. That same year, I began my bachelor's degree in Software Engineering.

I completed my bachelor's degree in Software Engineering at the Federal University of Goiás in 2016.

In 2015, I began working as a Software Engineer at [Codelitt](https://codelitt.com), a software consultancy company based in Miami, FL, USA.

In these 10+ years in the Software Industry, I've had the opportunity to write code,  lead teams, manage projects, and
lead departments. My passion is in building, but I came to realize that I also love to help others build.

- As an engineer, I had the opportunity to build dozens of production-grade applications, from small to large, from simple to complex, from monoliths to microservices.
- As an architect, I've had the opportunity to design and build systems that millions of people use. 
- As a team leader, I had the opportunity to lead teams of up to 15 people
- As a manager, I had the opportunity to lead departments of up to 40 people.
- As an executive, I had the opportunity to be the Chief Technology Officer in a company of 70+ people.

As an engineer, while I have extensive experience in Ruby on Rails, NodeJS, Typescript, and React, programming languages, and frameworks
are a means to an end. I am a firm believer that the best tool is the one that solves the problem at hand, and I am always open to learning new things.

During my career, I've had the opportunity to work with programming languages/frameworks such as:


| Programming Languages | Cloud Infrastructure | Databases   |
| --------------------- | -------------------- | ----------- |
| Ruby on Rails         | AWS                  | PostgreSQL  |
| NodeJS                | Google Cloud         | MySQL       |
| React                 | Heroku               | MongoDB     |
| TypeScript            | Digital Ocean        | Redis       |
| C#                    | Azure                | ElasticSearch |
| Java                  |                      |             |
| Groovy on Grails      |                      |             |
| Python                |                      |             |


As a manager, I've brought out the best in my team members and helped them grow as professionals. Always focusing on their strengths and helping them
improve their weaknesses. I've also had the opportunity to help them grow as people and help them with their struggles.
