I've recently tested several prominent AI-first IDEs from late 2024 and early 2025: **Cursor**, **Windsurf**, **Zed**, **Aide**, along with established AI assistants **GitHub Copilot**, **Sourcegraph Cody**, and **Amazon Q**. To provide a more comprehensive comparison, I've evaluated each based on the following criteria: **Pricing**, **Onboarding**, **UI/UX**, **Transparency**, **Efficiency**, **Code Quality**, **Context Management**, **Privacy**, and **Features**.

Before I jump into the evaluation itself, I would like to mention how Microsoft changed the entire game by offering an Open Source IDE. Most of the tools below are based on it, and IDE wise provide a similar experience.

## Evaluation Criteria

Each tool is evaluated based on the following criteria and scored from 1 to 10:
- **Pricing**: Affordability and available plans
- **Onboarding**: Ease of getting started
- **UI/UX**: Intuitiveness and user experience
- **Transparency**: Clarity on changes and suggestions
- **Efficiency**: Speed and productivity impact
- **Code Quality**: Accuracy and best practices
- **Context Management**: Handling large codebases and context
- **Privacy**: Data safety and user control
- **Features**: Breadth and uniqueness of functionalities

## Cursor: AI Pair Programming On Steroids

**Cursor** feels like an upgraded VS Code—familiar yet powerful. Standout features like **Agent Mode**, **Composer**, and the experimental **Bug Finder** allow complex multi-file refactoring with natural language descriptions. Context-aware AI suggestions are transparent and easy to review.

### Problems Encountered
- Context limits became noticeable in large projects, requiring more review cycles.
- The **Bug Finder** tool, although promising, sometimes provides false positives or irrelevant suggestions when dealing with highly modular codebases.
- Adding new files to the context can be cumbersome, and files tend to disappear on every request, forcing users to re-add them manually.

### Pricing
- **Free tier** available  
- **Pro Plan:** $20/month (advanced LLM integrations like GPT-4, Claude 3.5)  
- **Enterprise:** Custom pricing available

## Windsurf: Codeium's Autonomous Coder

**Windsurf** leverages **Cascade AI** to autonomously apply multi-file edits. Highly efficient for automation but less transparent and requires vigilant oversight.  

I tried Windsurf and, at first, I was impressed with how easy it was to use the **Cascade AI** mode. However, after only a few suggestions, it started ignoring previous ones and making unintended changes. It also struggled to follow directions like **CSS themes** and **styles**.

### Problems Encountered
- Over-aggressive suggestions required frequent intervention, particularly when refactoring complex logic.
- **Cascade AI** can sometimes break existing functionality when making changes, making it risky for large and interconnected codebases.

### Pricing
- **Free tier:** Unlimited basic AI features  
- **Pro subscription:** $15/month (premium LLM access like Claude 3.5)  
- **Enterprise plans** available

## Zed: Collaboration Meets AI Speed

**Zed** emphasizes real-time collaborative coding combined with powerful inline AI editing. It’s extremely fast and provides transparent control over AI interactions, ideal for teams that frequently collaborate on the same files simultaneously. Its UI is polished, though slightly different from VS Code.


### Problems Encountered
- Slight learning curve due to unfamiliar UI.
- While collaboration works seamlessly in small teams, scaling up to larger groups occasionally results in synchronization delays or conflicts, especially in fast-paced editing scenarios.

### Pricing
- **Free:** Collaborative editing and basic AI  
- **Zed Pro:** $12/month per user (includes Anthropic's Claude 3.5)  
- **Team and Enterprise plans** available

## Aide: Open-Source AI for Privacy-Minded Developers

**Aide** is fully open-source, allowing integration with various local or remote LLMs. It proactively aids debugging, provides inline transformations, and has a thoughtful rollback mechanism to quickly revert unwanted AI edits. It’s great for developers prioritizing privacy and extensive customization but slightly less polished compared to commercial alternatives.

### Problems Encountered
- UX is less intuitive, and initial configuration can be complex.
- Limited support compared to commercial alternatives, as the open-source nature means that compatibility issues can arise after updates.

### Pricing
- **Completely free** (open-source)  
- Cost depends on chosen external LLM APIs or local models

## Copilot: Effortless and Popular AI Coding

**GitHub Copilot** feels intuitive right from the start. The inline suggestions powered by GPT-4 integrate seamlessly into VS Code and make general coding tasks noticeably faster. It’s excellent for quickly generating boilerplate code or exploring unfamiliar APIs.

### Problems Encountered
- Limited context awareness in large projects.
- Occasionally makes inaccurate assumptions about variable naming and scope, leading to suggestions that may not align with the current code style or logic.

### Pricing
- **Individual Plan:** ~$10/month  
- **Copilot for Business:** ~$19/user/month  
- **Free** for students and open-source maintainers

## Cody: Ideal for Navigating Large Codebases

After testing **Sourcegraph Cody**, I appreciated its ability to deeply understand and reference my entire project. Cody’s context-aware suggestions saved significant time navigating complex projects and onboarding new team members. It’s especially powerful if you’re maintaining consistency across large codebases.

### Problems Encountered
- Initial setup can be time-consuming.
- UX complexity may overwhelm users unfamiliar with Sourcegraph.
- Processing very large repositories can slow down performance.

### Pricing
- **Free tier:** Limited use on Sourcegraph's cloud  
- **Enterprise:** Custom pricing, typically bundled with Sourcegraph Enterprise (self-hosting options available)

## Amazon Q: Comprehensive but AWS-Focused

**Using Amazon Q**, I found it particularly powerful when integrated within the AWS ecosystem. Its comprehensive capabilities—from coding and testing to documentation and reviews—are impressive, especially if you’re already embedded in AWS infrastructure. Outside AWS tasks, its effectiveness was good, though not quite as universally intuitive as Copilot.

### Problems Encountered
- Less intuitive outside AWS-specific contexts.
- Can be resource-intensive, leading to slower performance during complex lifecycle operations on large applications.

### Pricing
- **Free tier:** Available with AWS Builder ID  
- **Pro and Business tiers:** Custom pricing available
