title: 'Assumptions we make when estimating a project'
---

When we, as engineers, are estimating a project there are several assumptions we need to make. This mostly applies for the first time we are build said application.
When rebuilding one, the assumptions might be different, but because estimating is the business of guessing the future and hoping for the best, there is just so much close we can get to reality.

# 1. There is a product owner who understands the goal of the product

The goal of the engineering team when building a customer product is to solve a problem. Thus there is a need for someone to define what the problem is. This person doesn't need to know the end state or how we will solve the problem, but this person needs to understand the problem at hand and the processes that involve it. Preferably this person has knowledge about the users too, but it isn't a requirement.

# 2. Access to the cloud infrastructure (if there is any)
# 3. Access to a Google Cloud Account (or permission to create one)
# 4. We are assuming the custom layer will work for google maps
# 5. Access to any data sources they have access to
