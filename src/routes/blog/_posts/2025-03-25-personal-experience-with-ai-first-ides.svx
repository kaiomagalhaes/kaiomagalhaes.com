Over the last couple of weeks I've been tasked to review the AI-first IDEs available now in the first quarter of 2025.
The goal is to define which ones I'll keep using on a daily basis while I work across different projects/technologies.
The IDEs I'll be focusing on are: **Cursor**, **Windsurf**, **Zed**, **Aide**, **GitHub Copilot**, **Sourcegraph Cody**, and **Amazon Q**.

Before I jump into the evaluation itself, I would like to mention how Microsoft changed the entire game by offering an Open Source IDE. Most of the tools below are based on it, and IDE wise provide a similar experience.

## Evaluation Criteria

I'm evaluating each tool based on the following criteria and scored from 1 to 10:
- **Pricing**: Affordability and available plans
- **Onboarding**: Ease of getting started
- **UI/UX**: Intuitiveness and user experience
- **Transparency**: Clarity on changes and suggestions
- **Efficiency**: Speed and productivity impact
- **Code Quality**: Accuracy and best practices
- **Context Management**: Handling large codebases and context
- **Privacy**: Data safety and user control
- **Features**: Breadth and uniqueness of functionalities

## Cursor: AI Pair Programming On Steroids

**Cursor** feels like an upgraded VS Code—familiar yet powerful. Standout features like **Agent Mode**, **Composer**, and the experimental **Bug Finder** allow complex multi-file refactoring with natural language descriptions. Context-aware AI suggestions are transparent and easy to review.

### AI Models Available
- **OpenAI's GPT-4**
- **Anthropic's Claude 3.5/3.7**
- **Google's Gemini 2.0**
- **xAI's Grok**
- **Cursor's own cursor-small model** for basic code completion

### Problems Encountered
- Context limits became noticeable in large projects, requiring more review cycles.
- The **Bug Finder** tool, although promising, sometimes provides false positives or irrelevant suggestions when dealing with highly modular codebases.
- Adding new files to the context can be cumbersome, and files tend to disappear on every request, forcing users to re-add them manually.

### Pricing
- **Free tier** available  
- **Pro Plan:** $20/month (advanced LLM integrations like GPT-4, Claude 3.5/3.7)  
- **Enterprise:** Custom pricing available

## Windsurf: Codeium's Autonomous Coder

**Windsurf** leverages **Cascade AI** to autonomously apply multi-file edits. Highly efficient for automation but less transparent and requires vigilant oversight.

### AI Models Available
- **Codeium's Cascade Base model**
- **OpenAI's GPT-4**
- **Anthropic's Claude 3.5/3.7**
- **Google's Gemini 2.0**

### Problems Encountered
- Over-aggressive suggestions required frequent intervention, particularly when refactoring complex logic.
- **Cascade AI** can sometimes break existing functionality when making changes, making it risky for large and interconnected codebases.

### Pricing
- **Free tier:** Unlimited basic AI features  
- **Pro subscription:** $15/month (premium LLM access like Claude 3.5)  
- **Enterprise plans** available

## Zed: Collaboration Meets AI Speed

**Zed** emphasizes real-time collaborative coding combined with powerful inline AI editing. It's extremely fast and provides transparent control over AI interactions, ideal for teams that frequently collaborate on the same files simultaneously.

### AI Models Available
- **Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet** (default)
- **OpenAI's GPT-4**
- **Google's PaLM/Gemini**
- **Local models via Ollama and LM Studio**

### Problems Encountered
- Slight learning curve due to unfamiliar UI.
- While collaboration works seamlessly in small teams, scaling up to larger groups occasionally results in synchronization delays or conflicts, especially in fast-paced editing scenarios.

### Pricing
- **Free:** Collaborative editing and basic AI  
- **Zed Pro:** $12/month per user (includes Anthropic's Claude 3.5)  
- **Team and Enterprise plans** available

## Aide: Open-Source AI for Privacy-Minded Developers

**Aide** is fully open-source, allowing integration with various local or remote LLMs. It proactively aids debugging, provides inline transformations, and has a thoughtful rollback mechanism to quickly revert unwanted AI edits.

### AI Models Available
- **OpenAI's GPT-4**
- **Anthropic's Claude**
- **Local models via Ollama and LM Studio**

### Problems Encountered
- UX is less intuitive, and initial configuration can be complex.
- Limited support compared to commercial alternatives.

### Pricing
- **Completely free** (open-source)  
- Cost depends on chosen external LLM APIs or local models

## Copilot: Effortless and Popular AI Coding

**GitHub Copilot** feels intuitive right from the start. The inline suggestions powered by GPT-4 integrate seamlessly into VS Code and make general coding tasks noticeably faster. It's excellent for quickly generating boilerplate code or exploring unfamiliar APIs.

### AI Models Available
- **OpenAI's GPT-4** (for chat)
- **GitHub Copilot** (custom model for inline completions)

### Problems Encountered
- Limited context awareness in large projects.
- It occasionally makes inaccurate assumptions about variable naming and scope, leading to suggestions that may not align with the current code style or logic.
- Less effective for multi-file operations compared to dedicated AI-first IDEs.

### Pricing
- **Free:** Limited to students and open-source maintainers
- **Individual:** $10/month
- **Business:** $19/user/month (includes advanced policy controls)

## Cody: Ideal for Navigating Large Codebases

**Sourcegraph Cody** is designed to help developers navigate large codebases and understand complex code. It provides context-aware suggestions and can be used in various IDEs.

### AI Models Available
- **Sourcegraph Cody** (custom model for inline completions)

### Problems Encountered
- Limited context awareness in large projects.
- It occasionally makes inaccurate assumptions about variable naming and scope, leading to suggestions that may not align with the current code style or logic.

## Amazon Q: Comprehensive but AWS-Focused

Using **Amazon Q**, I found it particularly powerful when integrated within the AWS ecosystem. Its comprehensive capabilities—from coding and testing to documentation and reviews—are impressive, especially if you’re already embedded in AWS infrastructure. Outside AWS tasks, its effectiveness was good, though not quite as universally intuitive as Copilot.

### AI Models Available
- **Amazon Q Developer** (custom model optimized for coding)
- **Foundation models** from Amazon Bedrock

### Problems Encountered
- Less intuitive outside AWS-specific contexts.
- It can be resource-intensive, causing slower performance when running complex lifecycle operations on large applications.
- Steeper learning curve for developers not familiar with the AWS ecosystem.

### Pricing
- **Free tier:** Basic IDE features with monthly token limits
- **Professional tier:** Not specified in their website
- **Enterprise:** Custom pricing based on organization size
